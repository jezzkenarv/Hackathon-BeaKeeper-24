## BeaKeeper 

**BeaKeeper is a smart contract designed for efficient storage and verification of beacon state proofs. As Ethereum's EIP-4788 retains data for only the last 8191 blocks, BeaKeeper allows users to access this information seamlessly without needing to verify or submit their own proofs, thus streamlining data access and preserving historical state.**

This smart contract consists of:
- ProposerBlockProof 
- ProposerBlockProofScript
- MerkleProofTest
- Mock4788
- Mock4788Test
- IntegrationTest
